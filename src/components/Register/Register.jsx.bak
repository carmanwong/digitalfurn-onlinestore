                </div><div>1.4 Information on how DigitFurns. processes your personal data can be found in our privacy policy .

                </div><div>2.3 Membership is personal, non-transferable and is subject to these terms and conditions and any other rules, regulations, policies and procedures of DigitFurns. that you agree to by shopping and using offers, coupons and other services. Membership is limited to one per person per email address.

                </div><div>2.6 You are also liable for all activities carried out through your member account. This means that you are also responsible for taking all steps to ensure the security and confidentiality of login details such as email address and password. We recommend using a password that you don't use for other accounts. If your password or account has been hacked, you should change it quickly or contact customer service for further assistance.
                </div><div>3 DigitFurns. LOYALTY PROGRAM IN GERMANY  3.1 Membership is a national program and is only valid for purchases online at DigitFurns. website and in DigitFurns. stores in worldwide. You can only earn points when you shop as a registered member in DigitFurns. stores in worldwide or online, and for participating in activities that DigitFurns. announces from time to time. Points are not awarded for the purchase of gift cards.
                </div><div>3.2 The points earned are personal and cannot be transferred to another person or member.
                </div><div> 3.3 The points you receive when purchasing an item will be deducted from your account when you return the item.
                </div><div>3.4 In order to collect points, you must show your membership ID in an DigitFurns. or DigitFurns. store or log in to your account before making a purchase. You can view your points balance at any time under "My Account".
                </div><div> 4 POINTS, MEMBERSHIP LEVELS AND BONUS CHECKS4.1 The collected points count towards achieving the status "Plus Member" as well as for bonus checks (discount vouchers).
                </div><div>4.2 The date you become a member is considered the start date for a membership year. The membership year is the twelve months after the start date in each subsequent year. Your membership level is based on the points you have earned during the current or previous membership year, whichever is higher. If you are a new member or have not accumulated enough points for the second membership level (Plus Member), your membership will start at the first level (Member). If you have achieved the second level during a membership year, you will remain at the second level for the remainder of the membership year and the following membership year.
               </div><div>4.3 At the end of a membership year, all points for the next membership level for the following year will be reset to zero.
                </div><div>4.4 Bonus Check points are valid until the next start date.
                </div><div>4.5 When you have accumulated 250 points, a €5 bonus check will be issued and displayed under "My Account". You can redeem the bonus check in DigitFurns. and DigitFurns. stores as well as online.
                </div><div>4.6 The bonus check will be issued 30 days after the date on which the applicable point balance is reached and will be valid for 6 months from that point. You can only receive 5 bonus checks per calendar month and a maximum of 20 coupons in any 12 month period.
                </div><div>4.7 Bonus Checks cannot be exchanged for cash or gift cards or used for purchases of lesser value than the Bonus Check. The total must be €1 higher after cashing the bonus check. Non-commercial goods, such as shopping bags in stores, do not count towards the amount.
                </div><div>4.8 Each bonus check can only be redeemed once and applies to all items in the order. The discount is distributed proportionally to all items in the purchase, so that the discount percentage is the same for all items in the order. The respective reduction of the individual items of a purchase remains, even if individual items of the purchase are returned. The bonus check discount benefit is not redistributed to the remaining items if an item is returned.
                </div><div>4.9 When items are returned, the discount benefit (value) of the bonus check is forfeited. We only refund the amount you paid for the item, not the bonus check discount benefit. If you activate the bonus check to redeem it at an DigitFurns. store, it must be redeemed at checkout within 15 minutes of activation. Otherwise it will be irretrievably deleted and expire. Hard copies or screenshots of the bonus check will not be accepted. The legal process is excluded.
                </div><div>4.10 The bonus check cannot be used to purchase DigitFurns. gift cards or redeemed for previous purchases.
                </div><div>5 MODIFICATIONS, CANCELLATION AND/OR EXCLUSION FROM THE DigitFurns.
